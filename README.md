# NPC Launderers

Adds a new way of laundering money in Schedule I. Hire NPC Business Owners to launder your money for you. This mod is a work in progress and may contain bugs or incomplete features.

## Features

- **Seller NPCs:** Make use of existing NPCs in the game to launder your money.
- **Balancing:** The mod is designed to be unlock NPC Business Owners with **Friendly+** relationships.
- **Events:** Random events that can occur to designed to award/punish the player based on their relationship with the Launderer.
- **Custom UI:** Thanks to [this discord](https://discord.gg/QMzd7u6yZb), I learned how to created prefabs for custom UIs.
- **Envy System:** The Launderer will get envious of your money and will ask for a higher cut percentage at random.
- **Launderer Mix Requests:** The Launderer will ask for a mix request at random. This is an event that can increase/decrease the Launderer's cut percentage.

## Launderers

```

## Planned Features

- **More random mixes:** Currently, the Launderer will only ask for a discovered mix. I plan to add more random mixes that can be requested by the Launderer.
- **Streaks:** If you transact with a Launderer for a certain amount of time consistently, The Launderer can give you a bonus decrease in their cut percentage. This will be a random event that can occur at any time.
